# node_sound

I reserve the right to quit this project whenever, that said I am still finding fun new things to add every now and then...

A node based sound construction program written in rust. install the project, and run `cargo run --release` in the root directory on your OS of choice or visit the website: https://lubba-64.github.io/
.

Mobile support is on the docket for somepoint.
