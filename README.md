# node_sound

The scope of this project for me is done, so if others would like to contribute feel free, but I acheived everything I set out to do.

A node based sound construction program written in rust. install the project, and run `cargo run` in the root directory.

This works with WASM and all major desktop environments. Mobile is not (yet) supported.
