# node_sound

I reserve the right to quit this project whenever, that said I am still finding fun new things to add every now and then...

A node based sound construction program written in rust. install the project, and run `cargo run` in the root directory.

This works with WASM and all major desktop environments. Mobile is not (yet) supported.
